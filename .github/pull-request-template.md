Closes #15

# ✍️ Description
This PR seeks to add CI infrastructure to the repo. We all have specialized machines with our own setups so continuous integration serves as a form of sanity check of a base config. Hopefully when we pull code from `main`, CI infrastructure will prevent us from pulling in broken stuff.
